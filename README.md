# chat-server
A simple chat application powered by sockets. This chat application is more of a chat room, rather than a peer to peer chat. So this means that multiple users can connect to the chat server and send their messages. Every message is broadcasted to every connected chat user. It is just a basic chat server to learn concepts of socket programming in python.
Also, the server disconnects you from the network if you are not reachable due to any reason.
